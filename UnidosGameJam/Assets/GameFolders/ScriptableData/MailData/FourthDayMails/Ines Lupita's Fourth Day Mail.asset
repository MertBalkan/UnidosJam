    MailText: "Hello, how are you? Hope you are alright. Everything is going well
      here. Rather than hiring a social media manager, I decided to learn how to
      do it by myself and signed up for a course. It seems to be going pretty well
      because my online sales have increased tremendously! Now I have 14 different
      scents, people love the ones which reminds of them of their childhoods. Lots
      of people reach out to me and tell me how happy they are with my candles. This
      is truly gratifying. By the way, have you seen the Latinx daily news? They
      mentioned us in an article! I was very surprised to see it too. Anyway. I'm
      going to have a few business meetings this month. Trying to cut a deal to sell
      my candles in some stores. Wish me luck!  \nBest, \nInes."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hello Ines. I'm always happy when I get good news.
      Congratulations on the newspaper article! It is admirable that you try to improve
      yourself in every aspect of your business, and you seem to have succeeded in
      social media management too. Hmm, maybe I can help you with selling your candles
      in stores. I'm not making any promises, but I'll try to use some connections.
      \nBest,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hi Ines, just one question: when do you plan to use
      that $50,000? When I invested in you I thought this money was too much for
      a candle business, but I still trusted you. So I''m expecting you to use it
      for the business. From what you''ve said, you still need the help of others
      to grow your business. I''m not so sure about the decisions you make about
      your job. Anyway, thanks for keeping me updated at least.'
