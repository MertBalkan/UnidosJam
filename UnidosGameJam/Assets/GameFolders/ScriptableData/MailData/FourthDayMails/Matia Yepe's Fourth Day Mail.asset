    MailText: 'Bonjour!

      I spent this month in Paris with my boyfriend. It''s
      a great city, isn''t it? Of course, I didn''t come here just to travel. I show
      my designs to some collectors and fashion houses here. There are important
      fashion designers to meet and network is everything! Especially in this business.
      Since my family is not famous or anything, I try to make myself out of nothing
      so I have to make some connections... Anyway, I''m having a good time and learning
      a lot of new things. I believe these business contacts will be very useful
      to me. See you next month.'

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello Matias.I''m sure Paris is beautiful this time
      of year. I''m glad you had a good time. You''re right about the importance
      of business contacts, unfortunately sometimes no matter how talented you are,
      if you don''t know some people, no one will notice you. I think you made the
      right decision to go there, I hope you can make good connections. Have fun!

      Best,'
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello Matias.Did you go to Paris? And you expect me
      to believe it was just a business trip? I don't know about business contacts
      there, but you could try making business contacts here first! I think it's
      really easy to spend the money when someone else finances your project. This
      way, you can't keep this business going for very long, just so you know.
