    MailText: "Hello boss. Everything is going very well. Someone famous came to
      the restaurant this month, I really don't know who it is. But he shared a story
      on the internet that saying food here is very good. The whole place is packed
      now! We are really having a hard time keeping up with orders. We got new employees
      so it's under control. Everything is really great. It's almost time for noche
      buena and we are making the necessary preparations. We will distribute food
      to the homeless for noche buena. We don't have to do this, but I want to.It's
      not a big organization, but it's what I owe the people of my city. We will
      make new additions to the menu in the new year and it will also be a like a
      tasting event. Anyway, I'll let you know how it went next year! \nAdrian."

      I''m glad things worked out. You
      did it in a really short time, congratulations! I''m sure your family is very
      proud of you. Your plan for Noche Buena is very well thought. I''d like to
      support you on this so if you need help, just let me know.

      Best, '
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello. You're lucky that someone famous came to the
      restaurant, otherwise we would have kept losing money. I couldn't understand
      the reason why do you want to fill the place with homeless on Noche Bueno,
      everyone spends that holiday with their family. I thought you wanted to run
      a higher-end restaurant, not a charity organization. These types of places
      don't do such events, you are damaging your own image. Once you have the homeless
      people in, your customers won't want to come there. You'll also lose a lot
      of money. If only you were good enough in management to calculate these. Anyways.
