    MailText: 'Hello. I''m thrilled to share the news, but maybe you already know
      it this time! Have you seen the Latinx Daily News? We are there! We weren''t
      sure if we''d make it either, but we managed to release the trailer in time.
      The whole team is very happy about it. We have already started to get great
      feedbacks and build a community of our game. I think it will be easier after
      this step! This is a milestone and we''ve reached it. Now we will continue
      to work hard and release a larger trailer in a few months to bring the game
      to a wide audience. I hope you like our trailer, you can watch it on our site.
      By the way, I''m trying to use the money you gave us sparingly, but it looks
      like we''re going to need more in the future. When the time comes, I wanted
      to ask if you would consider supporting us in this matter.

      Thank you.'

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hi Sierra. I knew you could do it, but are you already
      on the news? Wow. Congratulations on publishing your first trailer. I haven't
      seen it yet, but I will for sure. I must say that I am very impressed with
      your passion for this work and I believe that it will pay off. It's going great
      so far. I think you should all take some time to sit back and enjoy this success
      before you get back to work.\_Don't worry about money, I believe in this project
      and will continue to support you.\nBest, "
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello. I really didn't believe you could get this trailer
      released on time so I must admit I am a little surprised. Congratulations.
      But you still have a lot to do so don't let this "success" relieve you too
      much. Maybe now you can actually start developing the game instead of dealing
      with another trailer?  Also, a few months ago you said that $50,000 would be
      enough for all your expenses, and I gave it to you. You have to find different
      ways to  sustain this business, because I can't give you money every time you
      ask for it.
