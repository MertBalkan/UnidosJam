    MailText: Hello, I got a call from a big home decorations brand this week, they
      said they liked my products very much and they offered me a partnership for
      a project. Did you set this up? If so, thank you very much! They said that
      after the deal, my candles will be available in many stores. I think I'll consider
      it.  Candles have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I don't
      want to give up on making candles, but I learned a lot as an entrepreneur in
      the last couple of months and I think it's time to take some risks to grow.
      I will keep you informed. Thanks again.

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: Hello Ines. I may or may not have anything to do with
      this. I guess you'll never know! This is your business, you make the decisions,
      all I can say that it was a lot of fun to witness your journey from the beginning.
      You did a great job in a very short time! so if you think it's time, it's time.
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello Ines. I have nothing to do with the people who
      called you. Are you sure about this? When large companies seek partnerships
      with such small businesses, they look after their own interests first. I don't
      think it will be very profitable for you. Besides, why would you need them?
      I have supported you enough from the beginning and I believed you could do
      it yourself.  Anyway, make this decision if you can bear the consequences.
      I won't be helping you if this fails.
