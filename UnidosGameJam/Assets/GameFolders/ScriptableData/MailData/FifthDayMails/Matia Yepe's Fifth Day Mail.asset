    MailText: "Hello!\nFinally I came back home. The connections I made in Paris
      opened new doors for me here. Apparently a famous Latin singer likes my designs
      and wants me to be her stylist! This is a great opportunity. I'll have to devote
      all my time to it. But that's my job after all! It is really valuable that
      people give opportunity to young designers. I'm suspending my own work for
      a while, when this short-term partnership ends, I will continue where I left
      off. I don't need to do much until next year's fashion week anyway.  (I'm not
      telling you the name of the singer, surprise for now!) That's the way things
      are for now, you'll see my designs on stage soon!\nBest, \nMatias"

      I really wonder who it is! From
      what you''re describing, it looks like you''ve got a really good opportunity.
      It was only a matter of time before important people noticed you! Congratulations,
      I have no doubt that you will do great work. Keep it up!

      Best,'

      I wouldn''t have invested in you
      if I had known from the beginning that you only intended to be a celebrity
      stylist. You said you wanted to follow your dreams and create your own brand.
      Maybe you think you can make money the easy way, but now you are no different
      from anyone else. If that''s what you want, maybe you shouldn''t even bother.'
