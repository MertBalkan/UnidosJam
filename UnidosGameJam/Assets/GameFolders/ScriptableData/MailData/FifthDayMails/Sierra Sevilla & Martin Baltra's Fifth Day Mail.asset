    MailText: "Hello, we had some glitches this month. After the hard work we put
      for the trailer we felt quite exhausted and took things a little slower. Also,
      one of our teammates' family is in Puerto Rico and it's giving us all a hard
      time. It was a difficult month in every way. However, I would like to share
      a few small updates about the game. We're making some content adjustments,
      lightening it up a bit to get the second trailer released on time. We will
      do our best to make the game as we imagine it in the full version. We're also
      looking to expand our team after the trailer, we need to power up our production
      for the demo. That's it for the month. \nThanks, \nSierra."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hi Sierra. I'm sorry for your teammate's family, if
      there's anything I can do, just let me know. I trust you with the decisions
      regarding the development of the game because so far you have not failed me.
      Every project falls behind the schedule time to time, the important thing is
      to get it back on track. Just like you did before and I know you can do it
      again. Thank you for informing me. \nBest,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hi Sierra. I'm neither disappointed nor surprised.
      It's been four months and this is not the first setback. I think I should get
      used to it. I'm sorry  for your teammates family, I really am, but it's your
      job to keep things in order. You cannot blame your team or their problems when
      you can't make progress. This money was handed to you, meaning you are responsible
      from everything, not them. Your bad leadership will cause this business to
      fail if you dont get yourself together. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
