    MailText: 'Hello there!

      You are about to find out that you made the right
      decision by choosing to invest in my project. The only thing holding back my
      progress was lack of money, and once this issue was resolved, I''ve started
      to climb up the ladder. Already my first designs are coming to life. I''m preparing
      a great collection for men, it will be groundbreaking. I bring traditional
      latin designs to the modern line, just what people need but don''t know yet.
      I work so hard you wouldn''t believe it. I''m keeping this project as a secret
      for now, but in a few months it will be everywhere! Stay tuned!

      Best
      regards, Matias.'

      I think the only way to achieve great success is to love what you do. I believe
      you can do it. Can't wait to see your collection, I hope I can find a few pieces
      for myself! Anyway, thanks for keeping me posted. \nBest,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello Matias,

      I don''t know if I made the right
      desicion by investing in you yet. Time will show that. Why are you making a
      collection for men instead of women? The majority of the fashion industry focuses
      of women. If you want to make money, you have to make the right decisions.
      You don''t seem to be doing that right now.

      You''d better reconsider
      this decision.'
