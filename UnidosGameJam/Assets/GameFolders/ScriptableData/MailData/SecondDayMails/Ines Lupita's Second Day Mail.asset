    MailText: "Hello! This is my first monthly update email and I already have a
      lot to tell you! My candle business now has a logo and I'm currently getting
      required licences for my candles proving they are a sustainable, vegan and
      obviously, not harmful to health. I believe it will go smoothly. I'm also looking
      to add  new scents like Con Leche and Az\xFAcar to my collection. I believe
      this will take some time before I fully launch my business and start selling
      candles online, but I'm not giving up. By the way, did I thank you enough for
      supporting me on this? If not, I should say I appreciate your support. \nBest,
      \nInes."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hello! \nIt's great to hear that you have started
      working and already made some progress. I think at this point there is nothing
      much for me to say, but do let me know if you need any support. And, no need
      to thank me, I'm glad to be a part of this journey.\nSincerely, "
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello,

      Good to hear from you. Just got one
      question popped into my head, I thought you already got the proper licensing
      for this business and it seems like I was wrong. This should have been more
      important then getting a new logo, since there is no business here yet needing
      a logo. Maybe you should set your priorities right.'
