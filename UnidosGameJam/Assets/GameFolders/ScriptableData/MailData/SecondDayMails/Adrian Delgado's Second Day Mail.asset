    MailText: "Hola! How are you? I have a good and a bad news. Bad news first, the
      \"rotten place\" I told you about turned out to be rotten for real and apparently
      I can't open the restaurant there. And the good news is this didn't make me
      quit! Jajaja.  I've been busy looking for a new place all month but I couldn't
      find the right spot yet. Maybe because I couldn't find the right commercial
      agent yet. But don't worry, I've got this. Anyway, talk later. \nAdri\xE1n"

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hello Adri\xE1n!\nI must admit you have a good sense
      of humor. I don't mind small set backs, it happens in any business. I also
      have good news for you, I'll have one of my friends get in contact with you
      about this issue and I think she can find you the place you are looking for.
      No worries. \nSincerely, "
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello Adrian.

      Thanks for informing me about
      your situation but I was expecting more from you. You are saying you wasted
      a month and I don''t find this funny. I invested in your business thinking
      that you could actually manage to pull it off but I''m having second thoughts
      already.'
