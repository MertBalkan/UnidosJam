    MailText: "Hi, hope you are doing well. I'd like to inform you that Mart\xEDn
      and I have started working on our project planning. We were supposed to deliver
      a finished game design document this month but my cat got very sick and Mart\xEDn
      was having power and internet outages. He's very upset about it... Anyway,
      I wanted to let you know that we had some small-ish problems which caused us
      to fall behind the schedule a bit this month. We are doing everything we can
      to get back on track, do not worry. I'm hoping to give you better news next
      month.\nBest, \nSierra."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hello Sierra,\nI'm very sorry to hear about your cat.
      Also for Mart\xEDn, because I know how it feels to be cut out from world by
      such problems.\_ Makes it very hard to get things done. So do not worry about
      the game design document, I believe you both did your best to finish it on
      time. Sometimes life gets in the way. Hope everything turns out for you both
      soon. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.\nSincarely,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello Sierra,

      Thanks for informing me about
      your progress, which doesn''t exist. It''s a bummer that you both have some
      personal problems this month, but things never get done by themselves. You
      both need to figure out how to menage this business because so far, all I hear
      is excuses.
