    MailText: "Hey boss! How is everything going? Me? Estoy muy bien!! I found a
      place for my restaurant, it's located on a very popular street near seaside.
      It costs me a bit but restaurant is open now so money is on it's way. Not coming
      fast, but it is coming. I run over the menu with my father, he's a great cook
      but he's too old to get back in kitchen now. He's so happy to see I'm restarting
      my family business. Anyway, since now I have a bigger place and an old father,
      I will need more staff. I'm on a cook hunt! Jajaja. You should come teste our
      Tamales! Everyone loves it! Anyway, see you later! \nAdri\xE1n."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hey Adri\xE1n, Congradulations on opening your restaurant.
      It's the start of a dream, ha? I knew you could pull this off. I can't wait
      to visit your restaurant, maybe not anytime soon but one day! Good luck on
      finding new staff members and let me know if is there anything I can do to
      help. Please send your father my best wishes. \nSincerely, "
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: "Hello Adri\xE1n. You found a strange way of telling
      me that you haven't made any profit yet. Congratulations on finally opening
      the restaurant, although I didn't like you renting an overpriced place without
      consulting it with me first. Since I'm the one who's funding this whole business,
      I think I should know where my money goes. Hope you find a decent cook."
