    MailText: "Hi, hope you are doing well. I'd like to inform you that Mart\xEDn
      and I have started working on our project planning. We were supposed to deliver
      a finished game design document this month but my cat got very sick and Mart\xEDn
      was having power and internet outages. He's very upset about it... Anyway,
      I wanted to let you know that we had some small-ish problems which caused us
      to fall behind the schedule a bit this month. We are doing everything we can
      to get back on track, do not worry. I'm hoping to give you better news next
      month.\nBest, \nSierra."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hi Sierra. Thank you for letting me know about the
      progress. I'm so glad that everything worked out on your end. Growing the team
      seems like the right decision, I'm sure your new teammate will do great things.
      I can't wait to see your trailer. Keep up the good work! \nBest,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello. You've finally made some progress. The fact
      that you have spent so much time on the game design document is a significant
      waste of time, if you ask me, you are still far behind your schedule. It's
      good to be so positive only when it's realistic. Hoping your new teammate is
      better than you on keeping promises. I can say that I want to see that trailer
      as soon as possible. So you make sure you're working hard, otherwise this business
      won't last long.
