    MailText: "Hello. I'm excited to share the progress with you. After the problems
      we had last month, we were finally able to focus on the project as it should
      have been. Our game design document is ready and we have already started developing
      the game. I know it took a while to get it ready but it's actually a quite
      important part of the process. Also, someone new has joined our team and he
      will be responsible for the designs so I can focus on narratives. We plan to
      release a short trailer of the game next month. This won't be a real trailer,
      but we think it will be useful for gathering our audience. I need to get back
      to work now, thanks for your help.\nBest, \nSierra."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: "Hi Sierra. Thank you for letting me know about the
      progress. I'm so glad that everything worked out on your end. Growing the team
      seems like the right decision, I'm sure your new teammate will do great things.
      I can't wait to see your trailer. Keep up the good work! \nBest,"
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello. You've finally made some progress. The fact
      that you have spent so much time on the game design document is a significant
      waste of time, if you ask me, you are still far behind your schedule. It's
      good to be so positive only when it's realistic. Hoping your new teammate is
      better than you on keeping promises. I can say that I want to see that trailer
      as soon as possible. So you make sure you're working hard, otherwise this business
      won't last long.
