    MailText: "Hello, this month wasn't easy but I managed to cross out all the tasks
      on my list. Firstly, I got all the licenses needed for my business. This means
      my candles are ready to be lit! So I can say I did a good job getting all the
      branding ready for the website earlier, which is on and going right now. I
      even made my first sale. Planning to add new products to the website this month
      and I'm currently trying to find a social media manager to reach out more people.
      I do everything on my own for now, but it is okay. This is all so exciting.
      \nBest,\nInes."

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: Hello Ines, I'm so happy to hear everything is going
      as you planned. Congratulations on your first sale! I think I should order
      one too, I'm sure they are all great. Keep up the good work! Best,
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: 'Hello Ines. I''m relieved that you finally got the
      licenses, my investment would have been wasted otherwise. Good to hear that
      you finally started making money. Also, do you really need a social media manager?
      I mean, it''s a candle business after all, you must have some free time to
      manage your social media accounts. I''d prefer you to use my money wisely. '
