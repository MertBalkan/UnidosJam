    MailText: Hello, I hope you read the Latinx Daily News, if not you should go
      and read it right away! They wrote that I am presenting my new collection.
      Pretty cool, right? For now it's only shown to a small community. When I have
      a bigger audience supporting me, I will move to the next league! I'm getting
      good feedbacks so far. Some people question why I don't make a collection for
      women (of course!), but I will stand out by appealing to a niche audience.
      They don't know how things work! I only have a few pieces in my collection
      at the moment, but they're all stars! I will take this collection to several
      different cities to show it. But that will not be the biggest thing I'll do.
      I am taking slow but firm steps forward.

    PositiveAnswerToThisMail: 'Hi Matias and wow, have you already released a collection?
      you are doing really well. It''s great that you''ve accomplished this in such
      a short time. Maybe the reason they ask why you don''t make a collection for
      women is because they want you to do it? This is a good thing. I look forward
      to the next big thing you will do in the future, good job!

      Sincerely,'
    NegativeAnswerToThisMail: Hello Matias.Congratulations, I hope your collection
      resonates well. Where you start is very important because people don't forget
      the mistakes you make. Appealing to a niche audience may not always be the
      right decision, after all, it's a business and we do it to make money, but
      you don't seem to care. If you are expected to make a collection for women
      and that makes sense, then make a collection for women?. Being in a newspaper
      today may sound nice, but you can't live in a fantasy world for long. Real
      life is not like that.
