    MailText: 'Hola! I''m Ines, a 23 years old business management graduate from
      Los Angeles. I''m originally from Cuba but I''ve moved to LA for my education
      and I miss my family there since then. Being away from home made me look for
      something to feel like I''m back there, and this is how I started making candles
      smells like home. You heard that right, scented candles! I already have a rich
      collection of scents coming from local foods to fruits and people love them.
      I mean, they LOVE them. I want to continue doing what I love as a business
      and share la cultura with the rest of the world now. I will need $50.000 to
      start my business and I need your help with this. I hope you believe in my
      dreams and walk with me on this path. Waiting to hear from you,

      Best,

      Ines.'
