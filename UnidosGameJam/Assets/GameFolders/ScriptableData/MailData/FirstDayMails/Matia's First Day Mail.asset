    MailText: "Hello, I'm Sierra Sevilla, a former multidisciplinary designer and
      architect who has switched her career into game design. I'm contacting regarding
      a game project we are working on with my friend Mart\xEDn Baltra. Our goal
      is to make games that have something to say and make an impact on people. The
      game we will make will be about the discrimination suffered by Latino immigrants.
      It's a sensitive matter but we are determined enough to delivered it on time.
      In order to bring this project to life, we need to expand our team and $50,000
      will be required for all our expenses in total for the next six month. We would
      love to have you on board in this project."
