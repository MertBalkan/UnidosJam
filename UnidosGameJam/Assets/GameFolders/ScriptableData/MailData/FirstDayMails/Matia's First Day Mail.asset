    MailText: 'Hola!

      I''m Ines, a 24 years old business management graduate
      from Los Angeles. I''m originally from Cuba but I''ve moved to LA for my education
      and I miss my family there since then. Being away from home made me look for
      something to feel like I''m back there, and this is how I started making candles
      smells like home. You heard that right, candles! I already have a rich collection
      of scents coming from local foods to fruits and people love them. I mean, they
      LOVE them. I want to continue doing what I love as a business and share la
      cultura with the rest of the world now. I will need $50.000 to start my business
      and I need your help with this. I hope you believe in my dreams and walk with
      me on this path. Waiting to hear from you,
