    MailText: "Greetings, my name is Matias Yepes and I'm a young but very determined
      fashion designer. I believe ones best way to express his true self is through
      fashion and I want to show the rich hispanic herritage to everyone with nicely
      designed pieces. From camp shirts to gaucho pants, panchos to panama hats everything
      I design will carry the traces of my true ethnic style. I already have an audience
      on social media who loves and supports me, with their help I believe I'll be
      in the legends league in no time. I need $50.000 to achieve my dreams. I hope
      you see my vision and chose to invest in me.\nSincarely, \nMatias."
