    MailText: "Hello, I'm Sierra Sevilla, a former multidisciplinary designer and
      architect who has switched her career into game design. I'm contacting you
      regarding a game project we are working on with my friend Mart\xEDn Baltra.
      We joined Unidos Hispanic Heritage Month Jam last year and the jam theme was
      \"supporting others\" We made a game about showing how a genuine support one
      gives to others make a change. We would like to continue working on this project
      to release a full version. In order to bring this project to life, we need
      to expand our team and $50,000 will be enough for all the expenses. Hope you
      choose to support us. \nBest, \nSierra"
