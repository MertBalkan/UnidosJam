    MailText: "Yoo! It's Adri\xE1n Delgado here. I hope you are well. I'm contacting
      you to talk about my new business plan. Well, it's not really a \"new\" business
      plan, because I'm reopening my families old restaurant! They were the best
      in their time. Place is a bit rotten now but I believe in myself and my dream.
      It will be the best of Puerto Rico again because we make the best Tepache.
      Not to mention our Enchiladas! It's my family herritage and I'll treat it as
      my baby by dedicating my whole life to it. The only problem is money right
      now and Luis told me you can solve that by one click. I need $50.000 for all
      the renovation and everything but I'm telling you, this place will worth millions
      when I'm done with it.\nLet me know when you are ready to start.\nCuidate,
      \nAdri\xE1n"
