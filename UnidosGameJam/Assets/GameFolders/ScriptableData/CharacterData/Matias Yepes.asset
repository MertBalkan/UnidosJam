      characterPositiveEnding: 'Matias is recognized and loved by a wide audience
        thanks to his unique designs reflecting the Latin culture.


        He is
        described by many fashion magazines as the most promising young designer
        in the fashion world.


        He is preparing to open his first store in
        Europe.



        He set up a fund to help young children who do not have
        access to education. Thanks to his reputation in the fashion world, he is
        running a very successful campaign.'
      characterNegativeEnding: 'Matias could not go beyond being a social media celebrity
        who is over sensitive about criticism.


        Although his designs were
        liked by many, he was afraid to take big risks and could not expand his business
        plan.


        He is waiting for the day when someone will discover his
        talent and help him on his way to become a great designer'
