      characterPositiveEnding: "After a grueling marathon, Mart\xEDn and Sierra finally
        published their first game.\n\nThe game  received great acclaim around the
        world.\n\nThey think they will win the Best Independent Game award at The
        Game Awards.\n\nThey have already started working on their new game.\n\nThey
        also started to organize free local workshops to share their experiences
        and grow the latinx game industry."
      characterNegativeEnding: "Mart\xEDn and Sierra were unable to cope with the
        stress they experienced and were not able to release their game at the time
        they promised.\n\nThe community they gathered after the successful trailer
        they released gave up hope and gradually started to abandon them.\n\nThey
        are still trying to release a short version of the game but they are having
        a hard time continuing the project because of economic reasons.\n\nThey wish
        they have never started this business."
