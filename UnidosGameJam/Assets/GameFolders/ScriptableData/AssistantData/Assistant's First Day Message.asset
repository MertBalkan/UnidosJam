      those people will make a difference with your support.'

      roots and I couldn''t think of doing it at a better time than this month, right?'

      I can.'

      plans. All of them are young, passionate people with hispanic origin. But each
      needs $50.000 for their startups'
    - 'Luis: You have a desicion to make.'
    - 'You: Hmm... it seems so. I better start thinking about it.'
